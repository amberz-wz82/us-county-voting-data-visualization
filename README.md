# info3300-static-d3-visualization
This is my first class project from INFO 3300 (Data-Driven Web Applications) that uses d3 library to visualize US county voting trends in the 2016 Presidential Election. The three data diagrams respectively show vote distribution vs. Geography, Poverty vs. Income, and Population density vs. Population Count for the US counties.
